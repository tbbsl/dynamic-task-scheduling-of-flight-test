# dynamic-task-scheduling-of-flight-test
## Motivation

For flight test engineering, the flight test task schedule is of great importance to flight test activities, which determines the flight test duration and directly impacts cost. While in the real flight test process, dynamic events may frequently occur, which affect the scheduled test plan. 

To adaptively adjust the real-world flight test schedule, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the dynamic task scheduling problem for flight tests with the objectives of flight test duration and task tardiness.
